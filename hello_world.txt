I want to be the very best
Like no one ever was.
To catch them is my real test,
To train them is my cause.
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide,
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside.

POKEMON: Gotta catch 'em all!

...

Your heart so true!
Our courage will pull us through!
